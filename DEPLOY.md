# Deploying Ukolio

## First boot

After bringing the stack up and applying migrations, the database has no
SystemAdmin — you must create one before anyone can manage workspaces or
access `/admin/*`.

```bash
make up                                              # build & start the stack
make migrate                                         # apply migrations

# Interactive (prompts for email + password):
docker compose exec backend php bin/console admin:create

# Non-interactive (e.g. provisioning scripts):
docker compose exec -T backend php bin/console admin:create \
    --email admin@example.com \
    --password "$(openssl rand -base64 24)" \
    --name "Ops"
```

Passwords must be at least 12 characters. Re-run the command later to add
additional SystemAdmins; existing users are detected by email and rejected.

## Upgrading from a build that seeded `admin@ukolio.com`

Earlier builds shipped a default SystemAdmin (`admin@ukolio.com` / `admin`)
that was created by the init migration. From `20260520_120000` onward, the
init migration no longer seeds that user, and a follow-up migration
invalidates the password on existing installs **if it is still the default**.

After `make migrate`:

1. The legacy `admin@ukolio.com` account is still in the database but its
   password is replaced with an unverifiable random string, so nothing can
   log in as it.
2. Run `admin:create` to provision your real SystemAdmin (above).
3. Log in as the new SystemAdmin and either rotate the legacy user's
   password via the admin UI or delete the row.

If your team had already rotated the admin password, the follow-up migration
detects this (it only acts when `password_verify('admin', …)` succeeds) and
leaves the account alone.

## Environment

Required variables — see `.env.example` for the full list:

| Variable | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `APP_ENV` | Set to `production` on real deployments. The boot guard then rejects the dev defaults for `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `S3_SECRET_KEY` (and anything shorter than 16 characters), and refuses `*` for `BACKEND_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` |
| `BACKEND_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | Allowed Origin(s) for `/api/*` and the Mercure hub. Space- or comma-separated; production must list explicit origins (no `*`) |
| `AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_KEY` | ≥ 32 chars; sign with `openssl rand -hex 32`. The boot guard rejects the placeholder value regardless of `APP_ENV` |
| `MERCURE_PUBLISHER_JWT_KEY` / `MERCURE_SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY` | Mercure realtime hub JWT keys; also generate with `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `MYSQL_*` | Database host + credentials |
| `SMTP_*`, `EMAIL_FROM` | Outbound mail (invitations, password resets) — sent via the async `amqp-consumer` worker, see "Async email delivery" below |
| `APP_URL` | Embedded in email links |
| `S3_*` | Object storage for task file attachments |
| `REDIS_*` | Used by the MCP session store |
| `RABBITMQ_*` | RabbitMQ host/port/user/password used by both the publisher (HTTP request path) and the supervisor-managed `amqp-consumer.php` worker |
| `BACKEND_AMQP_CONSUMER_PREFETCH` | Per-channel `basic_qos` prefetch for the consumer (default `10`) — caps in-flight unacked messages |
| `MEILI_*` | Meilisearch host/port/master-key + index prefix powering `/api/search` and the `search_tasks` MCP tool. Rotate `MEILI_MASTER_KEY` in production |

## Async email delivery

Invitations, password-reset, and email-verification emails are published to
RabbitMQ from the HTTP request and sent by a background worker, so SMTP
latency / outages no longer block sign-up / invite flows.

- **Publisher**: `Ukolio\Service\Queue\QueuePublisher` (`php-amqplib`), injected
  into the three providers. Lazy-connects on first publish per worker.
- **Queues**: `invitation`, `email-verification`, `password-reset` —
  enumerated in `Ukolio\Service\Queue\Enum\QueueEnum`. Messages are durable
  + persistent.
- **Consumer**: `backend/src/amqp-consumer.php`, managed by supervisor inside
  the `backend` container alongside FrankenPHP (see
  `backend/docker/supervisord.conf`). One process consumes all three queues
  via callbacks.
- **Retry**: handler exceptions trigger `nack(requeue=true)` — the message
  goes back to the queue and is retried indefinitely. There is no DLQ; rely
  on alerting on the `[program:amqp-consumer]` log stream.
- **Operations**:
  - Tail the worker: `docker compose logs -f backend | grep amqp-consumer`
  - Check queue depth: `docker compose exec rabbitmq rabbitmqctl list_queues`
  - Restart just the worker without bouncing the web process:
    `docker compose exec backend supervisorctl restart amqp-consumer`

## Scripting (sandboxed automations)

Workspace scripts run in a V8 sandbox (`ext-v8js`) executed by a dedicated
**script-worker** process — managed by supervisor inside the `backend` container
(`backend/docker/supervisord.conf`), separate from FrankenPHP and the
amqp-consumer so V8 never loads in the web tier. Manual and event-triggered runs
are enqueued automatically; **scheduled** triggers require a once-a-minute cron.

- **Scheduled-trigger cron (required for `Scheduled` scripts).** Run on the host
  (or a sidecar) every minute:

  ```cron
  * * * * * docker compose exec -T backend php /app/bin/console scripts:tick
  ```

  `scripts:tick` dispatches every active scheduled script whose cron is due. It
  is safe to run more than once per minute — a per-(script, minute) cache guard
  de-dupes dispatch. Without this cron, `Manual` and `Event` scripts still work;
  only `Scheduled` ones won't fire.
- **Due-date reminder cron (required for task due reminders, U-83).** Run on the
  host (or a sidecar) hourly:

  ```cron
  0 * * * * docker compose exec -T backend php /app/bin/console notifications:due-tick
  ```

  `notifications:due-tick` sends due-date reminders (in-app + email) for tasks due
  today and tomorrow to each task's assignee and watchers. Per-(task, user, type)
  de-duplication via the notifications table makes the hourly schedule idempotent —
  each reminder fires at most once per day. Without this cron, assignment / comment /
  mention notifications still work; only due-date reminders won't fire.
- **Recurring-task cron (required for recurring tasks, U-67).** Run on the host
  (or a sidecar) hourly:

  ```cron
  0 * * * * docker compose exec -T backend php /app/bin/console recurring-tasks:tick
  ```

  `recurring-tasks:tick` is the safety net for date-anchored recurring series: it
  enqueues the next occurrence of any active recurrence whose `next_run_at` has
  passed (to the `recurring-task-spawn` queue, consumed by the standard
  `amqp-consumer`). The common case — spawning the next occurrence when a recurring
  task is moved to a Finish status — happens inline via the event hook and needs no
  cron. A per-(recurrence, day) cache guard plus a carrier re-check in the handler
  keep both paths idempotent. Without this cron, recurring tasks still spawn on
  completion; only series the user never completes won't advance on schedule.
- **Operations.**
  - Tail the worker: `docker compose logs -f backend | grep script-worker`
  - Restart just the worker: `docker compose exec backend supervisorctl restart script-worker`
- **Outbound-fetch allowlist (optional hardening).** Set a workspace script
  variable named `UKOLIO_FETCH_ALLOWLIST` to a comma/whitespace-separated list of
  hosts (e.g. `hooks.slack.com, api.github.com`). When present, `ukolio.fetch`
  is restricted to those hosts (and their subdomains); when unset, any http(s)
  host is allowed.
- **Resource limits per run** (fixed): 5 s CPU, 64 MB memory, 20 `fetch` calls,
  200 task-API calls, no filesystem.

## Full-text search (Meilisearch)

`/api/search` (and the `search_tasks` MCP tool) is backed by a Meilisearch
sidecar. The `meilisearch` service in `docker-compose.yml` persists data to
the `ukolio_meilisearch` volume. Reindex is driven by the same RabbitMQ
worker as emails — every task mutation publishes a `search-reindex` message
that `Ukolio\Jobs\Handler\SearchReindexHandler` consumes.

After first deploy (and whenever the index settings change), populate the
index with:

```bash
docker compose exec backend php bin/console search:reindex
# Restrict to one workspace:
docker compose exec backend php bin/console search:reindex --workspace=123
# Drop everything and rebuild from scratch:
docker compose exec backend php bin/console search:reindex --flush
```

The command ensures the index + settings exist before walking tasks, so it
is safe to re-run.

## SSL termination

The default `docker-compose.yml` exposes plain HTTP on `${PROXY_PORT}`. To
terminate TLS at the proxy, layer on `docker-compose.ssl.yml`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.ssl.yml up -d
```

Requires `PROXY_HOST`, `PROXY_PORT_SSL`, `PROXY_SSL_CERT`, `PROXY_SSL_KEY`.
